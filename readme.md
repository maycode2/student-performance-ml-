# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction – SDG 4 Project

## 🧩 Step 1: Problem Definition – SDG Alignment

✅ **SDG Chosen:**  
SDG 4 – Quality Education

🎯 **Problem Chosen:**  
Predicting Student Academic Performance

The goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts students' final academic grade based on demographic and school-related features. This contributes to SDG 4 by identifying students who may need academic support early on, enabling interventions to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all.

📊 **Dataset:**  
UCI Student Performance Dataset  
[Link to dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)  
Real academic data from Portuguese schools.  
Target variable: `G3` (final grade)

## 🌍 Step 5: Ethical Reflection

### 🧠 Could bias in the data affect your model?

Yes. The dataset reflects a specific region and population, which may:
- Underrepresent students from rural areas or different backgrounds.
- Contain hidden socioeconomic or gender bias.
- Overfit to Portuguese school systems only.

To reduce this, future models should include more diverse and representative data.

### 🤝 How does your model promote fairness & sustainability (SDG 4)?

This model helps promote SDG 4 by:
- Predicting students at risk of low performance.
- Enabling early academic interventions.
- Supporting equitable, data-driven decisions in education systems.

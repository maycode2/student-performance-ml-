# Using Machine Learning to Predict Student Performance (SDG 4)

## 🎯 SDG Problem
This project focuses on **SDG 4: Quality Education** — specifically, predicting students’ final grades to identify those at risk of underperformance and enable early support.

## 🤖 ML Approach
We used a dataset of student background and academic records (student-mat.csv) from UCI.  
Features included study time, family support, absences, and prior grades.  
We trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict the final grade (G3).

## 📊 Key Results
- **Mean Squared Error:** 5.02  
- **R² Score:** 0.76  
- The model performs well and can reasonably predict final performance.

## 🌍 Ethical Reflection
Bias may exist based on geography, internet access, or school types.  
Fairness can be improved by using more diverse data.  
Still, the model supports SDG 4 by identifying students needing academic help.

## 💡 Impact
This solution empowers schools and educators to take **data-driven action** early, helping improve learning outcomes for all learners.
